In this workshop you have:

* Examined how basic Redis Caching can add value to an external application
* Used [RedisInsight] to interact directly with Redis
* Learned about more sophisticated use of [Redis Streams] and CDC
* Discovered that [RediSearch] is the gateway to really enhancing your application, making it much more interesting and useful to your users
* Had a brief taste of [RedisGraph] and the powerful [Cypher] language

But this is only the beginning. Redis can do much more! For example:

* Redis can count very [large numbers of distinct items in constant space] - great for determining if a user has every logged in before, or if an IP address has ever been used before; 
* Redis can provide [synchronous messaging] between clients (think of game servers, each serving thousands of users, but needing to rapidly send messages about user's status etc. from one server to another)
* Redis can [implement leaderboards] very efficiently; something that SQL really struggles to do!
* Redis supports [geospatial] indexes, so you can easily provide sophisticated mapping interfaces to users

These are just a few of the many features of Redis that often go unknown and unappreciated. I hope that this workshop has persuaded you to think more about Redis and maybe consider looking it at as so much more than a cache!

If you like what you see but are interested in a higher performance, more scalable, more secure and optionally managed Redis then why not [register for Redis Enterprise] and get 30 days free access to a 4 node cluster to really see what Redis can do!
