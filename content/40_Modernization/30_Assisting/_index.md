# Assisting Users in Real Time
Providing an indexing and query capability is great, but you can do much better in many instances: you know the kinds of search queries you can answer, so why not help the user pick those questions that have answers, and do it in real time, right in the UI itself? 

This is a valuable tool and is so subtle that users hardly know they’re using it. Nevertheless it can really drive value, ensuring that users get very quick and accurate answers to their questions, even when they’re not sure what they’re looking for!

Lets see how [RediSearch] facilitates this capability.
